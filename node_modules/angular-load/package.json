Call these methods to load a script\nor a CSS stylesheet asynchronously into the current page. Both methods return a promise that will be resolved\nonce the resource (script or stylesheet) has been loaded. In case of an error (e.g. HTTP 404) the promise will be\nrejected.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js\nangularLoad.loadScript('https://mysite.com/someplugin.js').then(function() {\n\t// Script loaded succesfully.\n\t// We can now start using the functions from someplugin.js\n}).catch(function() {\n    // There was some error loading the script. Meh\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n----\n\nReleased under the terms of MIT License:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
